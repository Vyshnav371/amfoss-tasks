## Install Ubuntu 20.04 [Desktop]
This was pretty easy considering the fact that i did install ubuntu for fun a few years back, even before i learned programing.
I’ve managed to dual boot my windows and ubuntu thou it’s a bit laggy at times since I have an old amd-a9 processor which gives me some trouble at times but overall, its working fine
