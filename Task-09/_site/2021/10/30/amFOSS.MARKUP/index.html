  <div class="article">
    <p>During the induction program, i really liked the amFOSS presentation and The work they are doing at the club, so i decided to try it out.
I knew there would be a set of tasks to complete, but when i saw the tasks i was shocked at first to see all the tasks, it all looked too much for a freshman. But now as i started doing my tasks i realised most of the tasks are not that hard provided we read the information given in the instructions with a few exceptions. I had quite a few problems in the begining with VScode as it always gives me path errors and some files were missing but i managed to fix almost all errors with a lot of googling.</p>

<p>Here i am going to describe my personal experience with each task</p>

<h2 id="task-00-ubuntu"><strong>Task-00 Ubuntu</strong></h2>
<p>This was quite straightforward as i did install ubuntu a long time ago. Since i am dual booting this helps me optimize my laptop and keep it well organized by keeping all the programing related stuff in ubuntu and my normal apps in Windows.</p>

<h2 id="task-01-staring-repo"><strong>Task-01 Staring repo</strong></h2>
<p>This was quite interesting but easy as the code was already given to us and all we had to do was copy the code into the webpage</p>

<h2 id="task-02-gitlinux-commands"><strong>Task-02 Git/linux Commands</strong></h2>
<p>This helped me learn all the linux terminal comands which i now understand is very powerful.
The idea of finding values and plugging it into maps as coordinates was interesting. Not surprisingly the coordinates was pointing to the college itself</p>

<h2 id="task-03-hackerrank"><strong>Task-03 HackerRank</strong></h2>
<p>Programing. This was the one i jumped to first because i learned Python for 2 years in school but it turns out the questions were a bit hard, which makes it a bit fair and unfair i guess to people new to programing i did 2 questions and reached top 15 according to hackerRank</p>

<h2 id="task-04"><strong>Task-04</strong></h2>
<p>TBD</p>

<h2 id="task-05-letmeseec"><strong>Task-05 LetMeSee.c</strong></h2>
<p>After watching cs50 lectures c programing was easy i managed to fix all bugs but had to spend a little more time fixing the logic otherwise this was ok</p>

<h2 id="task-06"><strong>Task-06</strong></h2>
<p>TBD</p>

<h2 id="task-07-golang-webscraper"><strong>Task-07 Golang WebScraper</strong></h2>
<p>I Really liked this task to be honest. To be able to scrape data with just a few lines of code is an extremely powerful feature. I used colly web scraper to scrape the data and compiled it in vscode</p>

<h2 id="task-08-javascript-explorer"><strong>Task-08 JavaScript Explorer</strong></h2>
<p>I needed quite a bit of prep for this, after watching week-8 of cs50 and some beginners guide on YT this was very easy and fun to do.
But sadly i couldnt extract the data from json format for chart and i couldnt find any good references so i took all the data and put it into script one by one. idk if i was meant to do that</p>

<h2 id="task-09-personal-website"><strong>Task-09 Personal Website</strong></h2>
<p>Basically this blog is the task so if you are seeing this blog means i did it..</p>

<h2 id="task-10-cs50"><strong>Task-10 CS50</strong></h2>
<p>These Lectures helped me a lot. Now i feel i have almost the same power in C as i have in Python with just a few videos which were perfectly explained by David(The Teacher of the Harvard Course) the problemsets are very unique and fun. I enjoyed the filter task where we have to make a image into black and white, sepia,make it reflect, blurring etc</p>

<h2 id="task-11"><strong>Task-11</strong></h2>
<p>I was never good at Designing just for this task i got photoshop and my friend Taught me how to make a very basic poster landscape and i did the rest.</p>

<h2 id="task-12"><strong>Task-12</strong></h2>

<h2 id="task-13"><strong>Task-13</strong></h2>
<p>Saw the question and realised this was beyond me or atleast the current me..</p>

<h2 id="task-14-bandit"><strong>Task-14 bandit</strong></h2>
<p>This was my most favourite task of them all. I really enjoyed this task,almost all levels were unique except the first 2 or 3 for which the directory was already given. the levels in which we had to sort and find unique or find the password after the word millionth in a big collection was very interesting</p>
