## INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
After I Learned to use my first programming language (i.e. -Python) I decided to continue learning in the field of CS because I genuinely enjoyed doing it. I believe I can do anything in this field if I put my mind into it. Hence, I decided to join AmFOSS as I think there will be like minded individuals and this will make me more dedicated to be better at what I do. If chosen I will work hard and try to bring up the clubâ€™s reputation
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
My basic goal is to be a better version of myself than yesterday in programming and by joining this club I feel like I can get exposure in different fields, Ultimately making me a better coder/programmer and 6 months is quite a bit to improve
### How would you contribute back to the club? 
"Hard work beats talent when talent dosen't work hard". I am willing to work hard so that my work or my teams work can be best in class and in doing so improve the reputation of the club
### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
No, the selection process was a bit confusing for first timers but necessary as I believe the club members should have a basic understanding of its core areas, it also enabled me to learn different things in this short selection span.
